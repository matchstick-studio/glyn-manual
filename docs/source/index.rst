Welcome to the GLYN CMS Manual!
===================================

The **GLYN CMS Manual** is a platform built on Wagtail with addditional functionality provided by Django and customizations built specifically for GLYN's use cases. A CMS is an application that allows you to publish, edit, modify, organise, delete and maintain the content on your site. It allows both developers and editors to manage content. Together with Wagtail, Django, and custom plugins, the GLYN CMS enables content to be published to a website that can be accessed on feature phones and scales up to smartphones, tablets, and desktop computers.
